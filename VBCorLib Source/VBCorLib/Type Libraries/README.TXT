** TYPE LIBRARIES **
These type libraries are required to compile VBCorLib source files.
They must be registered in order to be recognized by VB.

The VBVM6Lib.tlb is a modified version of the original file found at
www.xbeat.net/vbspeed. This version is fully compatible with the
original version, but includes additional methods use by VBCorLib.
